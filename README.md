# Multimodal-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-with-Langchain-and-Google-GenAI

Project Title:
Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Langchain and Google GenAI

Project Overview:
This project implements a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines advanced natural language generation and semantic search techniques. Built with Langchain, Google GenAI, and FAISS, the system allows users to query large datasets and retrieve relevant information quickly. The project integrates multiple tools and libraries to process diverse data formats, including text and images.

Key Features:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Utilizes Langchain and Google GenAI to enhance responses with data retrieved from external document sources.
FAISS-based Semantic Search: Implements FAISS to provide efficient similarity searches across large datasets, ensuring fast and relevant results.
Multimodal Data Handling: Processes and visualizes images using PIL and Matplotlib, supporting seamless interaction between textual and visual data.
PDF Parsing and Web Interaction: Automates the parsing of PDFs via PyPDF and enables data fetching from external APIs using requests and os libraries.
Technologies Used:
Langchain for building RAG pipelines.
Google GenAI for natural language generation.
FAISS for high-speed document retrieval.
PyPDF for parsing and extracting content from PDF files.
PIL and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization.
requests for handling HTTP requests, and os for file system operations.
How it Works:
User Query: The user inputs a question or search query.
Document Retrieval: FAISS retrieves relevant documents or information based on the query.
Language Generation: Langchain orchestrates the workflow, passing the retrieved data to Google GenAI for response generation.
Output Display: The system presents the generated response, with optional visual data display (e.g., images) using Matplotlib.
This project demonstrates the integration of multiple powerful tools to build a versatile, multimodal information retrieval system.
